    "## Time-dependent seasonal components are seasonal patterns that change over time. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as climate change, changes in consumer preferences, or technological advancements.\n",

Or, the seasonal pattern of electricity demand may change over time if people start using more air conditioning in the summer due to climate change.\n",

However, it is important to take them into account when making decisions that rely on time series data, such as inventory planning or budgeting."
